  * _Can anyone have a scan?_

Brain scanning is safe, but it is important to make sure that you have no metal in your clothes or in your body. We will check that you have no metal with you before you go into the scanner. To check whether it is safe for you to have a scan we will ask you questions beforehand including questions about any previous operations or accidents that may have involved metal. We will ask you these questions over the phone before your visit and again on the day of the visit.

While there is no evidence to suggest that MRI is harmful to unborn babies, as a precaution, the Department of Health advises against scanning people who are pregnant unless there is a clinical benefit. For this reason, if you are a girl then you will be asked whether you may be pregnant.  We will ask this question on the telephone before your visit. We will ask you again during your visit, with your parent/guardian present. If there is any chance that you might be pregnant, or if you don’t want to answer this question, you should not take part in this study.

  * _What is it like to have a brain scan?_

For one of the scans, you can just relax in the scanner while we take pictures. For the other scans, you can watch a film. We’ll talk to you in between scans. The scanner is very noisy when we take the pictures, so we will give you ear protection.

  * _Will joining in this study help me?_

We hope you might find it interesting to be part of a brain science project. However, there will not be any direct benefits to you. The results from this research may help us understand the effects of physical activity on brain function, and mental skills in young people.

  * _Will my details be kept private?_

Nobody else will be told your scores on the tasks. If there is a concern about your brain scan, we will contact your doctor. We will keep your brain scans and any other information we collect, unless you decide that you no longer want us to have it. You can ask us at any time to get rid of your information.

  * _What if something goes wrong?_

It is unlikely anything will go wrong. If you think there are any problems, or you have any worries about the study you can tell your parent or guardian and they can tell us, or you can talk to the researcher who will be looking after you.
