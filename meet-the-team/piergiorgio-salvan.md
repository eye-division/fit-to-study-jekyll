I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford. I am interested in the relation between physical activity and brain plasticity, and in how this can be used to improve cognitive functions and school outcome in childhood. In **Fit to Study** I am involved in the Brain Imaging sub-study.

Before this I carried out my PhD studies in the Division of Biomedical Engineering at King&#8217;s College London, investigating the neural predictors of language learning in neonates.
