I am studying for a PhD in health psychology with a focus on factors influencing young people’s physical activity.  Sport and exercise play an important part in my life: the reason I returned to study after a successful career in journalism was to understand and promote the positive impact that physical activity can have on our children’s health and wellbeing.  To balance sedentary time at my desk I run, swim and cycle; I coach youth football; and I chase around after my sons aged 14 and 11. I have an MSc in psychology, an MA in philosophy, politics and economics, and I am a qualified exercise instructor.
