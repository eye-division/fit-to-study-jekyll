I am a PhD student at the Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB), University of Oxford. I am very much interested in how various lifestyle factors (e.g. physical activity, sleep) affect the brain and cognition of children and adolescents. My PhD focuses on one of those factors: physical activity. Throughout my studies I aim to get a better understanding of the relationship between physical activity, cognitive performance and the brain in children.

Prior to commencing my PhD I completed a MSc in Neurosciences at the VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
