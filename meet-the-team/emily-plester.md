Sport has been my passion and sole focus since childhood, and I have been involved in high performance tennis since my secondary school days, playing for my school, county and captaining the University 1<sup>st</sup> team.  I recently graduated from Oxford Brookes in Sport and Exercise Science. During my degree, I chose to explore the effects of high intensity exercise on parameters such as sports psychology and cognitive functioning. These aspects of study have always greatly interested me – I completed my University dissertation on a very similar themes to ‘Fit to Study’.

I am excited to join the ‘Fit to Study’ project as it will combine my passion for all-things sport and allow me to gain more insight into a topic area that I find so fascinating.
