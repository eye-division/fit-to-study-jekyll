**Emily Curtis** | Research Assistant | Oxford Brookes University

I have been passionate about sport and exercise since early childhood and played a variety of sports growing up, as well as attending dance classes from the age of three.  Dance soon became a hobby which would consume the majority of my spare time as it still continues to do today.

I graduated university in 2014 with a BSc First Class Hons in Sport and Exercise Science. For the past year I have been working as a Health Advisor within the private healthcare sector, working to promote the benefits of a healthy and active lifestyle. Prior to this I worked for a number of years with children in a variety of settings including at a Summer Camp in the USA.

I am excited to join **Fit to Study** as a researcher, combining my love of research and working with children.
