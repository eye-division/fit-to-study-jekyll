**Nick Beale** | Study Manager | Oxford Brookes University

I joined Oxford Brookes in 2013, and before that I spent over 15 years working in the private sector, focusing on environmental research and consultancy in the low carbon energy sector.  At Brookes I have managed two intervention studies: **[cycle BOOM](http://www.cycleboom.org)** &#8211; a project to understand cycling among the older population and how this affected independence, health and wellbeing and, the **[Strengthening Families Programme 10-14 (UK)](http://mystrongfamily.co.uk/strengthening-families-programme-10-14uk)** &#8211; a seven-week whole-family intervention that seeks to strengthen understanding, care in 10-14 year olds.

My role on **Fit to Study** is to co-ordinate all designated administrative and operational activities.  I have been passionate about sport and exercise since growing up in a professional sporting family, playing competitive tennis from the age of 10, tennis coaching in my teens, through to competitive cycling which now takes up most of my spare time.
