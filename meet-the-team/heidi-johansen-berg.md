I head the Plasticity Group at [FMRIB](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib).  Our research focuses on how the brain changes with learning, experience, and damage.  As well as shedding light on how the healthy brain responds to change, our work also has implications for understanding and treating disease. For example, we are testing new methods for rehabilitation after stroke and we are assessing whether taking up exercise could slow the effects of age on the brain.

Heidi notes &#8220;_There is growing evidence of links between the body and the brain. The aim of **Fit to Study** is to better understand how school PE impacts on academic achievement_.&#8221;
