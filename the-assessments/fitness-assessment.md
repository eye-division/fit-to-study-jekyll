### **<u>INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS &#8211; 2018 Update</u>**

To gain insight into pupils’ fitness levels, we would like PE teachers to run a fitness test with all pupils in the year group. It is up to the PE teacher to decide when to run the fitness test, but we would like schools to administer the test towards the end of the academic year (June-July 2018)

Schools will be asked to run the 20m Bleep Test.

The instructions to be followed by teachers when running the tests as part of **Fit to Study** are the same as in 2017; below is an overview of what&#8217;s involved.  A result sheet for each class will need to be completed and returned to the research team.

**Bleep Test**

This shuttle run test is a multi-stage fitness test that indicates the maximum aerobic capacity and power. This is a well-known and well-practiced test in schools.  It involves running forward and backward on a 20 metre track. The test can be conducted indoors or outdoors, on a non-slip flat surface.

_<u>Equipment</u>_

  * Marking cones (or equivalent)
  * Measuring tape (at least 20m)
  * [Bleep test audio](https://soundcloud.com/user-538434746/20m-bleep-test-audio) (.mp3 file)
  * Ideally, the audio recording is connected to a music player/amplifier, so audible to all pupils.

_<u>Instructions for the teacher</u>_

  1. Measure a 20m distance and place cones at the lines indicating the distance that pupils need to be running repeatedly.
  2. The pupils stand behind one of the lines facing the second line, and begin running when instructed by the recording.
  3. The speed at the start is quite slow (8.5km/h). The pupils continue running between the two lines (Lap), turning when signalled by the recorded beeps. After about one minute, a sound indicates an increase in speed, and the beeps will be closer together. This continues each minute (Level). If the line is reached before the beep sounds, the pupil must wait until the beep sounds before continuing. If the line is not reached before the beep sounds, the pupil is given a warning and must continue to run to the line, then turn and try to catch up with the pace within two more ‘beeps’. The test (for an individual) is stopped when that pupil fails to reach the line (within 2m) for two consecutive ends after a warning.
  4. Pupils are instructed to remember the last number that was called before they stopped (Level-Lap) and report that to the teacher who is recording the scores on the **Fit to Study** [Result Sheet](https://www.fit-to-study.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FtS_Fitness_BleepResultSheet.docx). The teacher will make sure all pupils have completed the test, all results are recorded, and then return the results to the research team (refer to the instructions at the end of the [Result Sheet](https://www.fit-to-study.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/FtS_Fitness_BleepResultSheet.docx)).
  5. Before starting the test, introduce the pupils to the Bleep Test, make sure that they understand what they need to do; make sure that any pupils exempted from strenuous physical activity on health grounds, or have known health conditions, do not take part.
