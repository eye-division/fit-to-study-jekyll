    I am head of the Clinical Exercise and Rehabilitation (CLEAR) Unit at Oxford Brookes. We are part of a research team that  explore the effects of physical exercise in children and adults with brain/ spinal injuries, cognitive impairment, neurological diseases and long term physical disabilities.  I am also a Clinical Research Project Manager working in close association with the Department of Clinical Neuroscience and Department of Cardiology at Oxford University.

    Recently I’ve been working on a similar research project to Fit-to-Study investigating the effects of physical exercise on Year 9 pupils (age 13-14yrs). We’ve been using modern brain scanning techniques to explore the relationships between exercise, brain adaptations and motor skills. I’m also involved in a project examining the blood-pressure response to aerobic training in hypertensive young adults who had difficult birth histories.

  <p>
    On <strong>Fit to Study</strong>, I’ll be designing the physical exercise intervention and visiting schools to recruit volunteers from Year 8 to have their brain scanned at Oxford University!
