To gain insight into pupils’ level of activity during PE, a researcher will visit the school and will ask pupils to wear an activity monitor during PE. The school visit will be scheduled in advance.  All year group pupils will be provided with a wrist-worn motion sensor (accelerometer), to be worn on the non-dominant wrist, to record their physical activity during a PE lesson.  The sensor is used to detect movement, vibrations and orientation changes in all 3-axis, and is very accurate.

&nbsp;

A researcher will visit:

  * once at the start of the project (June-July 2017)
  * once in the final term (March &#8211; May 2018)
