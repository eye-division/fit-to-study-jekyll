Under the reformed National Curriculum, which local authority maintained schools have been required to teach since September 2014, PE remains a compulsory subject at all key stages. Academies and free schools do not have to follow the National Curriculum but are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum that promotes, among other things, the physical development of pupils.

The briefing paper &#8216;[&#8216;School Sport in England&#8217; N06836](http://live.fit-to-study.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SN06836.pdf)  [‘School Sport in England’ (Number 6836, 4 January 2017)](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN06836/SN06836.pdf) provides information on current policies and the latest developments in the provision of PE and sport in schools.

      PI-Dawes notes “<em>There is an increasing need for educational policy to be informed by evidence. <strong>Fit to Study</strong> will be an important component of the way we think in future about PE in schools</em>”.

Participation presents an excellent opportunity for pupils to see science in action and to recognise the importance of physical wellbeing. By participating schools are helping us to increase understanding of the importance of PE in the curriculum and this could potentially have a major influence on future education policy.
