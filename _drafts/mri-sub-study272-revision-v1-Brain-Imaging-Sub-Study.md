This is an optional part of the project and will be subject to separate written / informed consent from the pupils&#8217; parents/guardians. This will involve MRI brain scanning at the [Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib), as well as additional fitness and cognitive tests.

Further detail will be made available to schools that are selected to take part in the Main Study (from May 2017).
