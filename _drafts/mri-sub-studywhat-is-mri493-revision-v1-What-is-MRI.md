Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a method of obtaining images of the interiors of objects, especially living things such as humans and animals. It does not use ionizing radiation such as X-rays. Instead, it employs radio-frequency waves and intense magnetic fields to excite atoms in the object under evaluation. Patterns in this excitation are observed on a display. MRI can provide real-time, three-dimensional views of body organs, muscles, and joints without invasive surgery.
