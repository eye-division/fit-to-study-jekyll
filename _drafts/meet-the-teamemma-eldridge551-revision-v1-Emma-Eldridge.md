I have always been a sport enthusiast participating in a variety of sport clubs and activities including swimming, dancing, running, climbing and watersports. I was also privileged to be selected as a Games Maker for the Aquatics team at the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. After graduating from Exeter University with a BSc (Hons) in Human Biosciences, I have experienced a wide variety of roles from working as a Clinical Research Associate to an Outdoor Instructor. This has given me insight into the world of clinical research as well as promoting and encouraging a more adventurous and active lifestyle for adults and children alike. I am also a qualified Lifeguard and Level 2 Swimming Teacher allowing me to pass on my enthusiasm for swimming whilst keeping children safe and active in an aquatic environment. I am excited to join the **Fit to Study** team at Oxford Brookes University as a Research Assistant where I will be able to combine my passion for sport and education with scientific research.
