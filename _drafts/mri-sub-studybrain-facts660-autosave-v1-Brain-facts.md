The brain is divided up into many different areas. Each region functions in a specific way in order to help us during specific tasks, such as during reading or learning, or watching TV.

Underneath this organization of different functional areas, there is a whole network of connections that links them enabling complex human behaviour.Â MRI allows neuroscientists to untangle how the brain works and how it relates to everyday activities.
