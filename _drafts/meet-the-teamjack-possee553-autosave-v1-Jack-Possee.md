I am currently studying Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Bath, but for the past 9 months I have been on a placement in the Movement Science Group at Oxford Brookes University. During my time here I have worked with adults and children with neurological conditions in the Clinical Exercise and Rehabilitation Unit. I have helped run an exercise intervention looking at blood pressure response in hypertensive young adults, some of whom had difficult birth histories, and I am currently doing the capillaroscopy analysis. Finally, I have been involved in the screening, testing and training intervention of a study investigating the relationship between exercise and motor co-ordination in Year 9 pupils.

My role in **Fit to Study**, as a research assistant, will involve collecting data from the schools for the baseline assessments (May -July 2017). Sport has always been a big part of my life growing up with two older brothers, so seeing how exercise can improve quality of life has always been a great interest in mine.
