**Helen Dawes** | Principal Investigator | Oxford Brookes University

I initially trained and practiced as a physiotherapist specializing in sport physiotherapy and working in the UK and New Zealand; I also worked as a paediatric physio, with elite sport and for the National Coaching Foundation,Â prior to undertaking postgraduate training in exercise science and neuroscience. I then embarked on a PhD exploring exercise for people with neurological conditions. I have focused on optimizing performance of everyday activities through rehabilitation and on enabling physically active lifestyles in adults and children with disorders affecting movement such as: stroke, Parkinson&#8217;s, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis.
