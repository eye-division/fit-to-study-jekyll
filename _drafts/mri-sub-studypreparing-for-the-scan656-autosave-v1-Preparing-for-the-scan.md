<u>Food / drink</u>

In the two hours immediately before your brain scan, please avoid the following:

  * Sugary drinks & snacks
  * Fruit (including juices)
  * Caffeinated drinks

<u>What to wear</u>

In preparation for the scan we may ask you to change into pocket-less and metal-free &#8220;pyjama-style&#8221; top and trousers, which we will give you at the day of scanning and are available in a range of sizes.

At the end of the testing day there will be a short activity test, soÂ <u>please bring along some sport or comfortable clothes! </u>

<u></u><u>What NOT to wear</u>

  * Underwired bra (a sports bra with plastic clasps is fine)
  * Anti-bacterial or anti-odor/stink or silver impregnated clothing
  * Metal jewellery and Make-up
  * You will need to remove all metallic nail-varnish, all jewellery and all eye make-up before the scan (ideally, don&#8217;t come to the scan with it on if possible!
