### **<u>INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS</u>**

Your school has agreed to organise a short online assessment of physical activity, health and wellbeing on our behalf.   **All year 7 pupils should complete the task**, once at baseline in June/July 2017 and again at the end of the trial in June/July 2018 when pupils are in Year 8.

We would like the assessment to take place **in the school computer room**.

The questionnaire itself takes around 20 minutes, with additional time to go over the instructions for pupils.

All the instructions and materials that you and your colleagues will need to deliver the assessment will be posted to your school, unless you opt to print them yourselves.    The package will include these documents (click on the links below to download a copy) &#8211; they include sections on **Troubleshooting** and **FAQ**:

  * [Teacher Information Sheet](https://www.fit-to-study.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Q_Teacher_Information_Sheet.pdf) &#8211; for staff members organising the assessment
  * [Pupil Instruction Sheet](https://www.fit-to-study.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Q_Pupil_Instruction_Sheet.pdf) &#8211; for each pupil, with pupil name / ID Number

**It is very important that each pupil uses their correct ID number** as this will allow us to link all the data we collect during the study to the correct participant.

**When you receive the package:**

  * Please distribute a teacher instruction pack per class to the Year 7 teachers who will be organising the assessments
  * Ask them to book a computer room and read the teacher instruction sheet before the assessment so they understand what to do
  * Make sure they understand that the assessments should be completed as soon as possible

If you wish to try the assessment, please contact your researcher and they will provide the link and password.

This assessment is an important component of **Fit to Study**: our database alerts us when we have not received results!

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your researcher **as soon as possible** so we can help find a solution.
