### **<u>INFORMATION FOR PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS</u>**

### **<u>TROUBLESHOOTING</u>**

**1. I cannot login:**

  * If the pupil cannot login, make sure the ID-number is entered with capital letters and/or the date of birth is entered in the correct way: dd/mm/yyyy, e.g. 01/01/2002.

**2. Assessment fails to load**

  * If the assessment fails to load, please advise pupils to refresh the page.
  * If refreshing the page does not work, it may be that the cognitive assessment is not compatible with their internet browser at home. Please ask those pupils to (1) try a different browser, or (2) complete the cognitive tasks at school computers, after school hours.

**3. For all other issues**, please make a note of those issues and get in touch with the researcher directly. His/her contact details can be found on the information sheet that has been given to you or through your Head of PE.

### **<u>FAQ &#8211; FOR FORM-TEACHERS</u>**

** ****What do I do if…**

  * **… a pupil is not attending form time?** 

In the event that a pupil is absent during form-time, please make a note of this and make sure he/she will receive the homework instructions and sheets upon his/her return to school.

  * **… a pupil has opted-out of participation?** 

A pupil whose parents have opted-out of participation does not need to complete cognitive assignment. His/her name should not have been included on the pupils’ homework sheet in the first place. In the event that this does happen, please make a note (of pupil’s ID number) and let the pupil know that he/she does not need to complete the assignment

  * **… a pupil does not want to complete the tasks?**

Participation in the Fit to Study trial is a school-level decision. The homework that comes with participation in this trial should be treated like all other homework is treated, i.e. it is an obligatory part of school, unless a pupil has opted-out of participation/data-storage.

Please do make a note of the pupil’s ID number, which can be found in the Name-IDnumber conversion table included in each information pack.

  * **… a pupil does not have a computer at home?**

Make a note of his/her ID-number and make sure they can use school’s computers after school-time. If school-computers are not available after school, they may want to try to complete the tasks during a spare hour of school time.

  * **… a pupil has lost their instruction sheet?**

The information pack for each form-group teacher contains several extra copies of instruction sheets.  In case a pupil lost his/her homework assignment, provide them with one of the extra homework assignments that are in the pack and use the **pupil-ID number look-up table** to write down on the sheet their pupil-specific ID.

  * ** ****… I do not understand what to do?**

Please try to take time to go over the instructions again. If not clear, please get in touch with the Head of PE. If still unclear, you could contact the researcher will try to explain it to you to the best of his/her abilities. You can find the researcher’s contact details on your information sheet.

  * ** ****… I lost the instruction pack?**

The Head of PE has received a digital copy of all information packs (i.e. for each form-group teacher). Please contact your Head of PE and he/she could print the relevant information pack for you.

  * ** ****… I would like some more information about the Fit to Study project?**

There are several ways to get some more information about the project. First, you could ask your Head of PE, whom we’ve briefed in detail about the project and procedures. Second, you could explore this website, which contains information the project, the team and contact details. Third, you could email the researcher directly and ask him/her any questions you may have.

**<u>What</u>** **are the homework assignments about?** 

We are conducting some computer-based cognitive tasks that will help us find out how physical activity during PE might be related to pupils’ mental skills, such as memory or attention. **All of your Year-7 pupils** will be asked to complete these tasks as homework, once at baseline in June/July 2017 and again at the end of the trial in June/July 2018 when pupils are in Year-8.

**<u>Who</u>** **will give homework instructions?**

The homework assignment instructions will be given by the Year-7 **form-group teachers** during morning form-time and will take about 10 minutes. The homework assignment is split over two days. The form-group teacher will thus give homework instructions twice: homework assignment 1 during form-group day 1, homework assignment 2 during form-group day 2.

**<u>When</u>** **will the form-teachers set the homework assignments?  **

We would be very grateful if all form-group teachers could set the assignments during a single week in June. Homework assignment 1 is supposed to be given during **Monday** form-time, homework assignment 2 during **Wednesday** form-time. The pupils will have two afternoons to complete each homework assignment.
