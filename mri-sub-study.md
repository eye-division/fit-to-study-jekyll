The University of Oxford is conducting the study in order to investigate how the content of Physical Education (PE) lessons in school affects the brain and mental skills.

Participation involves some computer-based tasks, a fitness test and a **scan of your brain** that will take place at the [Oxford Centre for Functional MRI of the Brain (FMRIB)](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/divisions/fmrib), John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford.

We will also ask participants to wear a wristwatch-style activity monitor for seven days, either prior to or following the assessment, in order to record levels of physical activity.

  * **Cohort1** (recruited in 2017):  **two half-day visits** at FMRIB: one during **Summer 2017** and one during **Summer 2018**.
  * **Cohort2** (recruited in May/June 2018): **a 2.5 hours visit** to FMRIB, during May-June 2018 (this excludes the fitness test), and a follow-up computer-based session a year later (either online at home or at FMRIB).

**Note:** this is optional to the main study and is subject to separate written / informed consent from the pupils’ parents/guardians. You will be asked questions about your medical history to check your suitability for an MRI scan.
