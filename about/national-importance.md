Academies and free schools do not have to follow the National Curriculum but are required to provide a broad and balanced curriculum that promotes, among other things, the physical development of pupils.

The House of Commons briefing paper [&#8216;School Sport in England&#8217; (Number 6836, 4 January 2017)](https://www.fit-to-study.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/SN06836.pdf) provides information on current policies and the latest developments in the provision of PE and sport in schools.

Participation in **Fit to Study** presents an excellent opportunity for pupils to see science in action and to recognise the importance of physical wellbeing. By participating schools are helping us to increase understanding of the importance of PE in the curriculum and this could potentially have a major influence on future education policy.
