**Fit to Study** aims to:

  1. Develop a programme of study for PE lessons that aims to optimise the benefit of PE for brain function.
  2. Rigorously test the impact of this programme on fitness, wellbeing, cognitive function and academic attainment in Year 8 pupils, using a randomised controlled study in 100 state-funded secondary schools.
